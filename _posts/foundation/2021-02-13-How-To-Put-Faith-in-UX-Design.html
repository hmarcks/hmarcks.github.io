<blockquote class="ma0"><p class="mt2">
  &ldquo;If most of the big design decisions are made by people who you think are bad at design, or are unethical, you need to broaden what you think design is. The VP, the PM, the engineer, if they’re making decisions that “should be yours” or are “terrible”, then they’re designers too and powerful ones. This means there are only three reasonable choices:</p>
  <ul><li>Move into a role where you make the important decisions.</li><li>Become better at influencing decision makers.</li><li>Find a place to work that has higher standards (or start your own).&rdquo;</li></ul>
