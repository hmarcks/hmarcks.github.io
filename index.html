  <h1 class="heading heading--2 heading--light">Hello, I'm Hunter Marcks.</h1>
  <h2 class="heading heading--3 heading--light">I design digital products in Portland,&nbsp;Oregon.</h2>
  <p>I'm currently at <a href="https://renewfinancial.com">Renew Financial</a> where I work on our platform for financing energy-efficient home improvements.</p>
  <p>Often this involves learning about our business and user needs, sometimes it’s mapping user tasks and prototyping interactions, and occasionally it calls for a little css.</p>
  <h3 class="heading--timeline">2013–2014</h3>
  <p>Previously I worked on a tool to help businesses evaluate safer and more environmentally-friendly materials for their products. I also consulted on projects such as transit maps, an interactive sushi menu, and various websites.</p>
  <h3 class="heading--timeline">2009–2013</h3>
  <p>Before that I managed and designed websites at a liquor company where I also made a few vodka and whisky labels.</p>
