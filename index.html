            <span class="f4 fw8 mid-gray">1</span>
            <br>
            <p class="mt0">I recently designed our customer account where homeowners log in to choose their financing details, sign documents, and track their project with their contractor.</p>

          <li class="pb3">
            <span class="f4 fw8 mid-gray">2</span>
            <br>
            <p class="mt0">I work on the tools for our contractor partners where they can estimate financing plans, check property eligibility, help homeowners apply for financing, and manage their jobs.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="pb3">
            <span class="f4 fw8 mid-gray">3</span>
            <br>
            <p class="mt0">I also design for our underwriting software used by our internal team to help process the applications homeowners submit for financing.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Often I'm learning about our business and user needs, sometimes I'm mapping tasks and prototyping interactions, and occasionally I get into some front-end development.</p>
        <p>I established and manage our design system (design guidelines and living pattern library) in collaboration with our engineers to help deliver a high-quality and consistent experience more efficiently.</p>

    <h3 class="f6 f5-ns fw8 mb1">2013 – 2014</h3>
    <p class="mt0 mb5">Previously I worked on a tool to help businesses evaluate safer and more environmentally-friendly materials for their products. I also consulted on projects such as interactive transit maps and various websites.</p>
    <h3 class="f6 f5-ns fw8 mb1">2009 – 2013</h3>
    <p class="mt0">Before that I managed and designed websites at a liquor company where I also made a few whisky and vodka labels.</p>
