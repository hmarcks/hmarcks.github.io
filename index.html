      <p>I design software to help our contractor partners offer homeowners financing and manage their jobs, to help homeowners apply for financing, and to help our underwriting team process applications.</p>
      <p>Often this involves learning about our business and user needs, sometimes it’s mapping tasks and prototyping interactions, and occasionally it calls for some CSS.</p>

  <h3 class="f6 fw7 mb1">2013 – 2014</h3>
  <p>Previously I worked on a tool to help businesses evaluate safer and more environmentally-friendly materials for their products. I also consulted on projects such as interactive transit maps and various websites.</p>
  <h3 class="f6 fw7 mb1">2009 – 2013</h3>
  <p>Before that I managed and designed websites at a liquor company where I also made a few whisky and vodka labels.</p>
