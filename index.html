            <p class="ma0">I recently designed our customer account where homeowners can choose their financing details, sign documents, and track their project with their contractor.</p>

            <span class="f4 fw8 white">2</span>
            <br>
            <p class="ma0">I work on the tools for our contractor partners where they can estimate financing plans, check property eligibility, help homeowners apply for financing, and manage their jobs.</p>

            <span class="f4 fw8 white">3</span>
            <br>
            <p class="ma0">I also design for our underwriting software used by our internal team to help process the applications homeowners submit for financing.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Often I'm learning about our business and user needs, sometimes I'm mapping tasks and prototyping interactions, and occasionally I get into some front-end development.</p>
        <p>I established and manage our design system (design guidelines and living pattern library) in collaboration with our engineers to help deliver a high-quality and consistent experience more efficiently.</p>
