        <p class="mt3 mb2">The three main products I work on:</p>
        <ul class="list mt0 pl0">
          <li class="pb3"><span class="f6 b">1</span><br>I recently designed our customer account where homeowners sign in to choose their financing details, sign documents, and track their project with their contractor.</li>
          <li class="pb3"><span class="f6 b">2</span><br>I work on the tools for our contractor partners where they can estimate financing plans, check property eligibility, help homeowners apply for financing, and manage their jobs.</li>
          <li class="pb3"><span class="f6 b">3</span><br>I also design for our underwriting software used by our internal team to help process the applications homeowners submit for financing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Often I'm learning about our business and user needs, sometimes I'm mapping tasks and prototyping interactions, and occasionally I get into some front-end development.</p>
        <p>I established and manage our design system (design guidelines and living pattern library) in collaboration with our engineers to help deliver a high-quality and consistent experience more efficiently.</p>
